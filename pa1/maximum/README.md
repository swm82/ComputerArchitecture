# 2. maximum: finding the N maximum elements of a list (22 points)
Your task in this part of the assignment is to write a C program that returns the largest elements of a list of signed integers. Your program should take as a command line input the path to an input file:

```./maximum tests/test0.txt```

The first line of this text file says how many numbers will be in the list. The second line of this text file says how many of the largest elements you should return. The third line is a list of positive and negative integers from which you should select the largest numbers.

You program should print to the command line the list of the largest numbers in any order, separated by spaces.

The corresponding expected outputs are in the answers directory: answers/answer0.txt.
